Hi Yi,

I am restaging them now from HPSS. You will find the data here at PDSF,
/projecta/projectdirs/starprod/embedding/pp200_production_2012/*20152801
For the efficiency, you can read those .minimc.root files. There is McTrack branch to
record all the information of input MC particles. And there is a matchedPairs branch
to record the information of the reconstructed tracks. A bayesian division will
give you the efficiency.
By the way, restaging is still going on. I will let you know once it is done.

Regards,
Xianglei


execute root macro minimc_macro.cc with the following arguments:
entries: -1 = all entries
list: textfile of minimc files generated with find from embedding output directory
particle: whatever you want to call it, only used in output file

e.g.:
root4star minimc_macro.cc\(-1,"file_list.list","Protons",62)
