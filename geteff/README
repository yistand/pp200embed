get efficiency for Proton, Kaon, Pion

embedding data for P12id from pdsf

use geteff/make_efficiencies.C to read mc data SingleXXXXX_Embed_200GeV.root. 
it produces XXX200GeV.root files with hpt for efficiency
use geteff/fiteff.C to get fit paramters and store in .txt files.

use geteff/makeEffVsEta.C for TPC efficiency vs eta. It read mc data SingleXXXXX_Embed_200GeV.root. 
it produces EtaDep_XXX200GeV.root files with heta for efficiency for each species.
Then EtaDep_Inclusive200GeV.root is hadd from various species for more statistics. heta in EtaDep_Inclusive200GeV.root is updated with heta_mc/heta_re, then it is normalized to be average=1, as the scaling has already be taken into account in eff vs pt hisogram.
